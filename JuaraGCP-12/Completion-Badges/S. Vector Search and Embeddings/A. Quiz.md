>What are the general steps to build a search application by using Vertex AI Vector Search?
```
Encode data to embeddings, create an index, and search a vector space.
```

>How do text embeddings contribute to better understanding vs one-hot encoding?
```
Text embeddings convert text into dense, low-dimensional vectors that capture semantic relationships and context.
```

> Which comparison between semantic search and traditional keyword search is correct?
```
Semantic search addresses semantic similarity and excels at understanding word meaning and context, whereas traditional keyword search is effective for precise queries.
```

> What is the primary benefit of using hybrid search compared to semantic search alone?
```
Hybrid search combines semantic understanding with the ability to capture specific keywords and out-of-domain terms, ensuring a more comprehensive search experience.
```

> What is the main benefit of using vector search in RAG to address LLM hallucination?
```
Using vector search in RAG allows the LLM to access real-time information for fact-checking.
```

> What is the main purpose of using distance metrics like dot product distance in vector search?
```
To measure the distance between vectors in terms of semantic similarity.
```

> What are the two main techniques used by ScaNN to improve search performance?
```
Space pruning and data quantization.
