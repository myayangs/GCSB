>You're building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to synthesize up-to-date customer feedback for your company's products. What are the major steps in the correct order?
>1. Retrain the LLM like Gemini with updated information.
>2. Use embedding models to convert multimodal data (text reviews, customer photos, and review videos) into embedded vectors.
>3. Fine-tune the embedding model for more accurate embeddings.
>4. Search the vector space to retrieve recent product-related reviews.
>5. Augment a large language model (LLM) like Gemini with the retrieved information to generate an improved answer.

>What is the purpose of multimodal embedding?
```
It converts multimodal data to a numeric representation while retaining its meaning.
