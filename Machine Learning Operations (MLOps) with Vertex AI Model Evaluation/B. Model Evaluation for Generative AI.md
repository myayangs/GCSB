>An ML engineer is tasked with selecting the best-performing image classification model from three candidates, all trained on the same dataset. Their primary goal is to understand how each model performs in real-world scenarios and identify areas for potential improvement. Which evaluation approach would be most effective for this initial assessment?
```
Pointwise evaluation, focusing on the absolute performance of each model and identifying its strengths and weaknesses.
```

>When using evaluation methods like BLEU or ROUGE for LLM assessment, which of the following challenges is most likely to arise if the reference dataset is limited or biased?
```
The evaluation may underestimate the model's true capabilities because the reference data doesn't cover the full range of acceptable responses.
```

>A company is using a generative AI model to write marketing copy. Which evaluation approach would help them ensure that the generated content is both creative and relevant to their target audience?
```
Combining automated metrics for diversity and relevance with human evaluation for creativity and brand alignment.
```

>During the evaluation of an LLM, you find that the model often produces responses that sound fluent and grammatical but are factually incorrect. Which of the following evaluation challenges does this example illustrate?
```
Model complexity and decision-making
```

>Which component of an LLM block is responsible for storing and retrieving past interactions with the model to provide context for future requests?
```
Memory
```

>You're tasked with evaluating multiple versions of a language model for summarizing news articles. You want to know which model produces the most informative and coherent summaries. Which evaluation type would be most appropriate?
```
Ranking evaluation: have human evaluators rank the summaries from different models based on their overall quality.
```

>You're evaluating a language model designed to generate creative stories. Which of the following evaluation approaches would be most relevant? Select all that apply.
```
Calculating the perplexity of the model's output.
```
```
Assessing the diversity and originality of the generated stories.
